## Let’s build a javascript web application framework
##### This is a totally free and open source tutorial for javascript programmers that have already completed a course like (codecademy)[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript]. If you find mistakes please let me know!

## welcome !

This tutorial comes in a few self-contained parts, each covering important ideas. At the end of each part you will have a useful framework for building projects. The goal is to understand the why and how of common fundamental patterns and techniques inside frameworks before diving in at the deep end into a framework which does everything for you.

In each chapter you will learn helpful concepts and finish a useable javascript framework.  

Chapters:
#### 1. A Naive Framework - we implement our first framework, and discuss how to improve it.
* A better Framework - we rebuild chapter 1 into event & model reactive modules, and learn some important lessons on the way.
* better model component - we design a safer API for interacting  state and make a browser localstorage module
* Templating Component - for rendering our application.
* Let's build an App - we take our framework for a drive ( eisenhower or fm npm)
* Routing / History - we make our framework more user friendly by harnessing browser features
* AJAX  - Communicating with other APIs
* Testing & TDD -
* Basic Deployment -

## Why should I follow this tutorial?
Many starting web developers are duped into thinking that learning frameworks is learning how to program. There is often no distinction made between the two. However this is untrue.

Upon beginning the web development journey, people are rarely presented with a structured computer science course. Its up to the beginner to piece things together, which is hard. I certainly struggled!

Typically people will go from learning basic javascript types and tricks on codecademy, and then get caught in the hype of huge frameworks like angular and redux that abstract everything else away. 

This can impede longterm learning and job prospects as a developer. 
Even if every job posting seems to ask for some handful of the latest shiny toys like redux and react, It’s up to us developers to own our profession and not let HR people that might not know better dictate the way we think of our jobs.

A lot of this trouble also comes from people marketing their frameworks or sponsored training courses as magic bullets ( launch your first app in one hour with X framework ! No brain required ! ) . 

Frameworks cannot solve every problem and are not always appropriate. They are like real-world things. Bicycles are great, but if somebody asked you to build a hospital, you wouldn’t build it out of bicycles right? Frameworks are like this too, they do different things and solve different problems.

Learning the intricacies of any one framework or tool is certainly valuable, but it’s far more valuable to expose yourself to programming in some sort of structured way first.

Most applications can be built with their own solutions in a more efficient way, when you know the fundamentals of design and a bit more about how your programming language works.
