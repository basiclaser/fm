## welcome !

This tutorial comes in a few self-contained parts, each covering important ideas. At the end of each part you will have a useful framework for building projects. The goal is to understand the why and how of common fundamental patterns and techniques inside frameworks before diving in at the deep end into a framework which does everything for you.

Chapters:
1. #### A Naive Framework - we implement our first framework, and discuss how to improve it.
* #### A better Framework - we rebuild chapter 1 into event & model reactive modules, and learn some important lessons on the way.
* #### better model component - we design a safer API for interacting  state and make a browser localstorage module
* #### Templating Component - for rendering our application.
* #### Let's build an App - we take our framework for a drive ( eisenhower or fm npm)
* #### Routing / History - we make our framework more user friendly by harnessing browser features
* #### AJAX  - Communicating with other APIs
* #### Testing & TDD -
* #### Basic Deployment -
